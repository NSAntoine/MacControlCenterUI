# Compatible Demo

> **Note**
> 
> This is a legacy demo project that was useful in early stages of development, but will be replaced with a new project that mirrors the functionality of the Latest Platform Demo project once a backwards-compatible replacement for MenuBarExtra (macOS Ventura and later only) is added to the library.
